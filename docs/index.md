## Documentation index

The [latest docs](/docs/latest/) is the recommended version, unless you need to
use an older version of the library.

There is also archived documentation for every previous release of GLFW 3:

 - [Archived docs for 3.0 - 3.0.4](/docs/3.0/)
 - [Archived docs for 3.1 - 3.1.2](/docs/3.1/)
 - [Archived docs for 3.2 - 3.2.1](/docs/3.2/)
