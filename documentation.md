## Documentation

### User guide

The [user guide](GLFWUsersGuide277.pdf) (PDF) is
a task-oriented guide to the API.  It does not describe every detail of GLFW,
but instead attempts to get you started in the areas of your interest.

---
### Reference manual

The [reference manual](GLFWReference277.pdf) (PDF)
describes every function and constant of the API, but isn't necessarily the
best way to get started using GLFW.

---
### Wiki

GLFW has a wiki at
[wiki.glfw.org](http://wiki.glfw.org/).

---
### Patch submitters guide

The [patch submitters guide](patchguide.html)
describes best practices for creating and submitting patches to GLFW.  It is
recommended reading for anyone who wishes to contribute to the project.
