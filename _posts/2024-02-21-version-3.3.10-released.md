GLFW 3.3.10 is [available for download](download.html).

This is a bug fix release.  It adds fixes for issues on all supported platforms.

Binaries for Visual C++ 2010 and 2012 are no longer included.  These versions
are no longer supported by Microsoft and should not be used.  This release of
GLFW can still be compiled with them if necessary, but future releases will drop
this support.

Binaries for the original MinGW distribution are no longer included.  MinGW
appears to no longer be maintained and should not be used.  The much more
capable MinGW-w64 project should be used instead.  This release of GLFW can
still be compiled with the original MinGW if necessary, but future releases will
drop this support.
