GLFW 3.3.9 is [available for download](download.html).

This is primarily a bug fix release for all supported platforms but it also adds
[libdecor](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/libdecor/libdecor/) support for
Wayland.  This provides better window decorations in some desktop environments,
notably GNOME.

With this release GLFW should be fully usable on Wayland, although there are
still some issues left to resolve.
