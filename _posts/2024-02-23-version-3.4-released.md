GLFW 3.4 is [available for download](download.html).

This is a smaller feature release, as a basis for future work.

It adds runtime platform selection, better support for Wayland, both Wayland
and X11 enabled by default, more standard cursor shapes, custom heap allocator
support, per-window mouse input passthrough, window title query, a conforming
Null platform available everywhere, window hints for initial position, new
(harmless) errors informing about missing features, several platform-specific
hints, a new native-access function, a hint for selecting ANGLE backend, various
other minor features and fixes for issue on all supported platforms.

GLFW 3.4 uses the Visual Studio 2013 subset of C99 and will not compile with
Visual Studio 2012 or earlier.
