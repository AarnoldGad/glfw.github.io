### Alternatives to GLFW

No library can be perfect for everyone, and GLFW is no exception.  Here
are a few alternatives known to be stable:

- [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/) - A completely Open Source
  alternative to the OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) library with an optionally
  open event loop
- [Simple DirectMedia Layer](http://www.libsdl.org/) - A cross-platform
  multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard,
  mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL, and 2D video framebuffer
- [Simple and Fast Multimedia Library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/) - A free
  multimedia C++ API that provides you low and high level access to graphics,
  input, audio, etc.

There is also a
[list of alternatives](http://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/windowtoolkits/)
to GLFW (actually alternatives to GLUT) maintained on OpenGL.org.
