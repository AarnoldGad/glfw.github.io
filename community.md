## Community

If you have questions related to the use of GLFW, we have a
[users web forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/glfw/discussion/247562/)
and the IRC channel `#glfw` on [Freenode](http://freenode.net/).

If you have a bug to report, a feature you'd like to request or a patch
you wish to submit, please submit an issue or a pull request to the
[GLFW repository](https://github.com/glfw/glfw/issues).

If you find a problem related to this website, please submit an issue to the 
[website repository](https://github.com/glfw/website/issues).

Finally, if you want to help with the development of GLFW, join us on GitHub or
IRC.  There is also an occasionally active
[developer's mailing list](https://lists.stacken.kth.se/mailman/listinfo/glfw-dev).
